# Bangalore House Price Prediction:

This project predicts house prices in Bangalore based on features like BHK (number of bedrooms), square feet area, and location. It uses Machine Learning techniques to analyze housing data and provide accurate price predictions, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.


Project Overview:

The real estate market in Bangalore is one of the fastest-growing in India. Buyers often face difficulty in estimating the fair price of a property due to variations in location, amenities, and property size.
This project aims to solve that problem by:
Training a machine learning model on real housing data.
Allowing users to input property details (BHK, Sqft, Location).
Returning a price prediction for the given property.

Features:

✅ Predicts house price based on BHK, Sqft, and Location.
✅ Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Flask.
✅ Simple web interface for user interaction.
